# **üó£Ô∏è Project Overview:**
This project is a P2P File Sharing Protocol. 
The protocol is driven by messages of the following types:
- Handshake
- Choke
- Unchoke
- Interested
- Not Interested
- Have
- Bitfield
- Request
- Piece

# **‚öôÔ∏è Setup Steps:**
We were only able to run the code in localhost since we were not able to connect to the CISE machines.

1. Open 6 terminals on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory in all of the terminals
3. Run the following command to compile all java classes: "javac *.java"
4. Each terminal is going to run a different peer, based on a PeerId passed in as Command Line Argument.
5. On each terminal, run java PeerProcess <peerID>. Check PeerInfo.cfg for valid PeerID's.
6. The program will start running and you will see the logs of the program.

# **What we were able to achieve and what we did not:** 

*What we were able to do*
- Create a connection between all the peers
- Send the handshake to the peers
- Send interested message to interested peers
- Send the optimistically unchoking of a peer

*What needs improvement*

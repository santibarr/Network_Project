# **üó£Ô∏è Project Overview:**
This project is a P2P File Sharing Protocol. 
The protocol is driven by messages of the following types:
- Handshake
- Choke
- Unchoke
- Interested
- Not Interested
- Have
- Bitfield
- Request
- Piece

# **‚öôÔ∏è Setup Steps:**
We were only able to run the code in localhost since we were not able to connect to the CISE machines.

1. Open 6 terminals on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory in all of the terminals
3. Run the following command to compile all java classes: "javac *.java"
4. Each terminal is going to run a different peer, based on a PeerId passed in as Command Line Argument.
5. On each terminal, run java PeerProcess <peerID>. Check PeerInfo.cfg for valid PeerID's.
   ```
   //each line is for a different terminal
   java PeerProcess 1001
   java PeerProcess 1002
   java PeerProcess 1003
   java PeerProcess 1004
   java PeerProcess 1005
   java PeerProcess 1006
   ```
6. The program will start running and you will see the logs of the program.

# **What we were able to achieve and what we did not:** 

*What we were able to do*
- Read in the PeerInfo.cfg and Common.cgf files correctly
- Create a connection between all the peers
- Send the handshake to the peers
- Send interested message to interested peers
- Send the optimistically unchoking of a peer

*What needs improvement*
We were not able to get the logging for the preferred neighbors, the functionality of the have message, downloading of piece, choking and unchoking, and completion of download.
We implemented the code for these functionalities, however, we were not able to make them function effectively.
